# Finance Tracker
### Personal use project to keep track of expenses and savings from our ING account.

This project loads the CVS file from the ING account and saves the columns in a local H2 database.
I am using H2 database in order to have this application portable for security reasons, meant to be run from a USB file.
Our main requirement is having everything offline. Hence I coded it myself, in order to keep our finance totally private.

**Progress so far as of 6/15/2023**

_Styling done with help of ChatGPT üëç_ saved a lot of time with the css and html
